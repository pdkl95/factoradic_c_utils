  * [fact2dec] Big speed improvemewnt (~50%). Uasing GMP's factorial function
    was performing redundant work. Now the factorial is computed in parallel
    as we walk through the factoradic positions.

  * [benchmark.sh] Added additional SKIP= options "dec2fact" and "fact2dec"
    that disable benchmarks by conversion type.

  * [minor bug] Fixed the --version option.
